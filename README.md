This little line drawing was conducted for the purpose of exploring deterministic approaches to interactive art (rather than parametrically, programmatically, or born from the 'story' that data might tell). 

This work was completed in partial fulfillment for the course Data Mining the City at Columbia University GSAPP in 2017. 

The following code is written in Python 3 and intended for execution on the Processing 3 IDE, which can be downloaded at https://www.processing.org/download/. Ensure that the Python mode is installed an enbaled on Processing 3 (Java is enabled by default). Only the .pyde file is required for proper execution. Enjoy!
